## 1. Project Summary

**Working name:** `projection-mapper`

This project is a **projection/video mapping engine** that:

- Runs on **Raspberry Pi** and **macOS**.
- Renders multiple video/graphics feeds onto skewed surfaces (rectangles, quads, meshes) in real time on a **projector**.
- Is **interactive**, driven by **MIDI**, **audio input energy**, and remote control via **client/server APIs**.
- Persists scenes, cues, and configuration in an **embedded SQLite3** database file and stores media assets on the filesystem.

High-level goals:

- A **core C++ library** encapsulating domain logic (scenes, surfaces, feeds, cues, playback).
- A **C++ server** exposing a **remote API** (over TCP/IP) using the core library.
- One or more **C++ clients** (CLI, UI, etc.) using that API.
- A **C++ rendering engine** that connects to the projector and executes scenes in real time.
- **Projects** group cues and show-level configuration (controllers, MIDI channels, globals) into an ordered show file.

> **Language policy:**
> Where pragmatic, **use C++** for all components (core, server, renderer, baseline clients). Other languages may be added later, but C++ is the default and must remain a first-class citizen.

## 2. High-Level Architecture

The repo is structured as a C++-oriented monorepo with four main components:

1. **Core Library (`/core`)**
   - Language: **C++17+**.
   - Responsibility: Domain model & logic only. No networking, no rendering, no DB.
   - Knows about: Scenes, Surfaces, Feeds, Layers, Cues, Playback state.
   - Includes: JSON serialization helpers and validation utilities for IDs and the main entities.
   - Used by: Server and (optionally) headless tools/clients.

2. **Server (`/server`)**
   - Language: **C++17+**.
   - Uses the core library to:
     - Persist state in an **embedded SQLite3** database file (default path: `./data/db/projection.db`).
     - Manage asset metadata (files are stored on the host filesystem).
     - Expose a **remote API** over TCP/IP to clients.
     - Optionally serve the Composer SPA from a static web root when `--web-root` is provided (same-origin with the API).
     - Coordinate with the **Renderer** process to apply changes & control playback.
     - Listen for renderer connections and keep an in-memory registry of connected renderers by unique name.
   - The **server machine is physically connected to the projector** (via the Renderer).
   - The server exposes a **HTTP+JSON** API with `/api/projects`, project-scoped endpoints like `/api/projects/{projectId}/feeds|scenes|cues`, renderer control under `/api/projects/{projectId}/renderer/*`, plus `/api/renderer/*` and `/api/demo/*`.
   - Persistence is handled through the DB module (e.g., `db::SqliteConnection`, `db::SchemaMigrations`) and repository layer.
   - HTTP transport is implemented with the vendored single-header **cpp-httplib** server (`server/third_party/httplib.h`) inside the `http::HttpServer` wrapper.

3. **Renderer (`/renderer`)**
   - Language: **C++** using **openFrameworks** + addons (e.g. `ofxMidi`).
   - Responsibility:
     - Real-time rendering of scenes on the projector display.
     - Handle MIDI input, audio input, and apply LFOs.
     - Render multiple video feeds mapped to skewed rectangles/quads/meshes.
   - Communicates with the Server via a local **control protocol**.

4. **Clients (`/clients/...`)**
   - Primary implementations: **C++** (e.g. CLI via standard C++ + a networking library).
   - Responsibilities:
     - Connect to the Server over TCP/IP.
     - Manage scenes, feeds, surfaces, cues, and playback.
   - Must **never talk directly to the Renderer or DB**.

### 2.1 Data Flow Overview

- **Clients → Server**
  - CRUD operations on Project-scoped Scenes, Surfaces, Feeds, Cues.
  - CRUD operations on Projects (ordered cues + project settings).
  - Playback control: `play`, `pause`, `gotoCue`, etc.

- **Server → SQLite3 & Assets**
  - Persists domain state in an embedded SQLite3 database file on local disk.
  - Associates logical feeds with asset paths on disk.

- **Server → Renderer**
  - Sends high-level commands:
    - “Load this Scene definition”
      - Use the `loadSceneDefinition` renderer protocol message to send the full Scene plus referenced Feeds as a single payload.
    - “Update Surface #23 vertices”
    - “Switch Feed of Surface #10 to `feedId=xyz`”
    - “Play / Pause / Seek cue X”
  - Renderer processes commands and updates its internal representation.

- **Renderer → Server**
  - Connects to the server on the renderer port and sends a `Hello` message containing its unique name (used as the renderer id).
  - Server rejects duplicate names and returns an error response to the renderer.

- **Renderer → Projector**
  - Fullscreen rendering window on the projector display (server machine’s GPU output).

> **Renderer protocol & inputs:**
> - `LoadSceneDefinition` is a supported control message for sending a full Scene plus the referenced Feeds in one payload.
> - Renderer control messages include project-scoped ids (e.g., `projectId` alongside scene/cue/feed ids).
> - `Hello` payloads from renderers must include a unique `name` field; the server uses this to register each renderer.
> - The renderer consumes MIDI via `ofxMidi` (e.g., CC #1 mapped to brightness) and audio input energy to modulate scale.

### 2.2 Project Model & API Surface
- **Project fields:** `id`, `name`, `description`, ordered `cueOrder`, and `settings` (controllers map, MIDI channels, global config key/values).
- **Scoped entities:** `Feed`, `Scene`, and `Cue` are all scoped by `projectId`; IDs are unique within a project.
- **Persistence:** tables `projects`, `feeds`, `scenes`, `cues`, and `project_cues` are keyed by `project_id` in SQLite.
- **Validation:** project references must point to existing cues in the same project; MIDI channels limited to 1–16; controller names/targets must be non-empty.
- **HTTP API:** 
  - `GET /projects` list projects, `GET /projects/{id}` fetch one.
  - `POST /projects` create, `PUT /projects/{id}` update (id enforced from path), `DELETE /projects/{id}` remove.
- `GET/POST/PUT/DELETE /projects/{projectId}/feeds|scenes|cues` manage project-scoped entities (payloads include `projectId`).
- `POST /projects/{projectId}/renderer/loadScene` loads a scene from the specified project.
- `POST /projects/{projectId}/renderer/playCue` loads the cue's scene (including cue surface overrides) on the renderer.
- `GET /assets` lists filesystem assets (same under `/api/assets`) to populate the Composer asset browser.
- `POST /assets` uploads an asset (multipart/form-data `file`, 2GB max).
- `DELETE /assets/{name}` removes an asset by filename.
- Cue deletion is blocked when the cue is referenced by the same project.
- The server accepts both `/api/...` and root-level `/...` paths for the HTTP API.

## 3. Technology & Tooling Conventions

### 3.1 Languages & Toolchain

- **C++**
  - Standard: **C++17** (minimum), C++20 features allowed if guarded or agreed.
  - Build system: **CMake** (top-level project) where possible.
  - openFrameworks has its own build system; we will integrate via:
    - Dedicated CMake targets, or
    - Using openFrameworks’ project generator and documenting the linkage.
  - Compilation targets:
    - macOS (desktop).
    - Raspberry Pi (Linux/ARM).

- **SQLite3**
  - Embedded, file-based database. Default location: `./data/db/projection.db` (relative to the server working directory).
  - Access library (C++): system `sqlite3` C API (no heavy ORM). Only the **server** component may include `sqlite3.h`.
  - All DB access must be encapsulated behind a clear repository/DAO layer in `/server`.

### 3.2 Testing

> **Mandatory:** Unit tests for **all classes or modules with logic**.

- Test framework: **Catch2** (default choice) for all C++ components.
- Test naming & layout:
  - Tests live under `<component>/tests`.
  - Test files end with `_test.cpp`.
  - For small modules, tests can also live in a `tests` subdirectory next to the code.

Examples:

```text
/core/src/scene/Scene.cpp
/core/tests/scene/Scene_test.cpp

/server/src/db/SqliteConnection.cpp
/server/tests/db/SqliteConnection_test.cpp
```

### 3.3 Tooling & dependencies

- **JSON**: The `/core` library uses [nlohmann::json](https://github.com/nlohmann/json) for serialization. It is vendored as a
  single header at `core/third_party/nlohmann/json.hpp` and can be included with `<nlohmann/json.hpp>`. The serialization module
  provides the JSON conversions for IDs, enums, and the Feed/Surface/Scene/Cue classes.
- **HTTP**: The server uses the single-header [cpp-httplib](https://github.com/yhirose/cpp-httplib) library vendored at
  `server/third_party/httplib.h`.

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements

- Server code must include tests covering the DB layer, repository layer, and HTTP API handlers.

### Build notes
- The root `CMakeLists.txt` enables testing and pulls in `/core`, `/server`, `/renderer`, and `/clients/commandlineclient`.
- The core library target is named `projection_core`; it is built as a C++17 target from `core/src`.
- Catch2 is provided locally under `core/third_party/catch2` (lightweight harness plus `Catch2WithMain` target) for unit tests,
  and the test executable is registered with `add_test` for ctest integration.
- Server builds must link against the system SQLite3 library and use the embedded DB file; no external DB service/container is expected.
- Renderer builds require openFrameworks; macOS builds support separate x86_64 and arm64 targets via `CMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES`.
- Raspberry Pi builds are native-only and may need `OPENFRAMEWORKS_PLATFORM`/`OPENFRAMEWORKS_LIB_DIR` overrides for the OF lib path.

### Dockerization notes
- Single container for the server that includes SQLite3 client library and runtime. No separate DB service is required.
- Mount `/data/db` (or `./data/db` relative to the repo) as a volume so the SQLite3 file (default `projection.db`) persists across runs.
- Expose the server’s remote API port; renderer and clients connect over the network, but DB access stays in-process.

### Open questions / TODOs
- Schema evolution for SQLite3: migrations tracked via a schema version table under `/server`.
- Validate performance on Raspberry Pi with the embedded DB file (consider WAL mode if needed in the future).
- Renderer roadmap: FFT analysis, LFO modulation, and optional ofxPiMapper integration.
